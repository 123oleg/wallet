        <p>Simple Bitcoin is a standalone wallet for Android devices which does not depend on any centralized service and gives you full control over your precious bitcoins.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A single-page application which allows you to store your bitcoins securely and transfer them easily.</p></li>
<li><p>It is an <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Deterministic_wallet">HD wallet</a> which means your balance and full transaction history can always be restored using a single mnemonic code should anything bad happen to your device. </p></li>
<li><p>This wallet is intended for mobile devices, hence it does not store a full <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain">Blockchain</a> but instead acquires all the relevant data from random Bitcoin nodes using an <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability#Simplified_payment_verification">SPV technique</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="mnemonic-code" class="anchor" href="#mnemonic-code" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mnemonic code</h3>

<p>Simple Bitcoin is a so called HD wallet: all Bitcoin addresses and private keys come from a single mnemonic code which is essentially a phrase comprising of 12 random words. Please remember: whoever knows your mnemonic code also fully controls your bitcoins so it should be kept private at all times.</p>
<p><a name="mnemonic"></a> Also, <strong style="color:#FF0000">in case if you lose your device or forget your wallet password only mnemonic code can get your bitcoins back, it's that important!</strong> Ideally one of the following actions should be taken once a new wallet is created:</p>

<ul>
<li>Either write your mnemonic code on a piece of paper and store it in a really secure place.</li>
<li>Or encrypt your mnemonic code using wallet password as a key and store it wherever you like. For that you can use AES-256 text encryption in <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.paranoiaworks.unicus.android.sse&amp;hl=en">Secret Space Encryptor</a> which is a popular open source Android app. </li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="unconfirmed-transactions" class="anchor" href="#unconfirmed-transactions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Unconfirmed transactions</h3>
<p>Here's a simple heuristic: <strong>treat any unconfirmed incoming transaction as if it does not exist yet</strong>. There are a lot of technical reasons for this and 
the rule applies to all wallets, not just to Simple Bitcoin Wallet. Just wait for at least one confirmation and you'll be fine.</p>

<h3>
<a id="transaction-fees" class="anchor" href="#transaction-fees" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Transaction fees</h3>
<p>Every transaction you send must have some fee attached to it. Fee goes not to wallet developer but to Bitcoin miners who include transactions in blocks and
thus give them confirmations. The higher fee you choose the faster transaction will be confirmed.</p>

 
<h3>
<a id="many-addresses" class="anchor" href="#many-addresses" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Wallet addresses</h3>
<p>Due to privacy considerations wallet has not one but many addresses. In fact, wallet's default address gets changed on every new incoming transaction. Never worry about it as all the old wallet addresses stay valid forever and you can use any of them to receive funds.</p>

<h3>
<a id="lost-password" class="anchor" href="#lost-password" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In case you lose your password...</h3>

<p>
It's important to understand that Simple Bitcoin Wallet is not a centralized service so you can't regain access to your funds by just providing an email or something like that.
 Here you'll need to restore a wallet using your mnemonic code and this is how to do it step by step:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Erase all current wallet data if you know how to do that (such an option is typically available in System Settings), otherwise just reinstall an application from scratch.</p></li>
<li><p>Open fresh application and you'll be given an option to restore your wallet instead of creating a new one, choose it and enter
 your mnemonic code as well as new wallet password.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Important note: restored wallet will appear empty at first and that is completely normal as it needs some time to catch up with network.
